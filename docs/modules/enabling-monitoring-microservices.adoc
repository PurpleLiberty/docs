Metrics come in various forms, including counters, gauges, timers, histograms, and meters. You can enable metrics in your Open Liberty application with the MicroProfile Metrics feature, which defines annotations that help you quickly build metrics into your code. 

To learn how to use MicroProfile Metrics to enable and provide metrics from a microservice, see link:https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-metrics.html[Providing metrics from a microservice].
