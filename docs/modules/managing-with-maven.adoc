= Managing build processes with the Open Liberty Maven plug-in

You can build and test your applications, whether they are simple applications with a single module or more complex applications that consist of multiple modules.

After you define the details and dependencies of a project, Maven automatically downloads and installs all of the dependencies. It also runs automated tests on an application after it is built. If the tests donâ€™t pass after you update an application, the build fails. You must fix your code.

The following coordinates for the Maven plug-in are required:

[source,xml]

<groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
<artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<version>3.1.0</version>
