= Using the Open Liberty Maven plug-in

Open Liberty provides a Maven plug-in to simplify and manage build processes.

After you define the details and dependencies of a project, Maven automatically downloads and installs all of the dependencies. It also runs automated tests on an application after it is built. If the tests donâ€™t pass after you update an application, the build fails and you know that you need to fix your code.

The coordinates for the Maven plugin are:

[source,xml]
----
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
<version>2.22.2-M1</version>

Java EE applications consist of multiple modules that work together as one entity. To learn how to build an application with multiple modules by using Maven and Open Liberty, see link:https://openliberty.io/guides/maven-multimodules.html[Creating a multi-module application].
