= Authenticating to the {name-example-secured} example application API endpoint

:parent-context: {context}

The {name-example-secured} example application provides a default HTTP endpoint that accepts `GET` requests if the caller is authenticated and authorized.
The client first authenticates against the {RHSSO} server and then performs a `GET` request against the {name-example-secured} example application using the access token returned by the authentication step.
