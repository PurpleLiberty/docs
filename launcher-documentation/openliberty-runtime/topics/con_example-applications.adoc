= Example Applications

{ProductName} examples implement link:http://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html[Microservice patterns] such as:

* Health Check
* REST or HTTP endpoint
* link:https://docs.openshift.com/online/dev_guide/configmaps.html[Externalized Configuration]
* Circuit Breaker

Example applications use these patterns to show how to create the fundamental building blocks of cloud-native applications and services, such as:

* Creating HTTP APIs.
* Integrating your application with a relational database to provide persistent data storage.
* Implementing the health check and circuit-breaker patterns to ensure that your services can withstand a traffic overload and network issues.
* Externalizing the configuration of your applications to make them more secure and easier to scale.
//* Securing your applications with {RHSSO} to provide authentication and authorization functionality

Each example application is implemented in one or more runtimes.
