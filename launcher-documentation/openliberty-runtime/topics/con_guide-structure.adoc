= Guide structure

Each guide is stored in a separate directory. The main file for the guide is `$REPO_HOME/docs/GUIDE_NAME/master.adoc`.

.Example `master.adoc` file

== {name-launcher} Development

This chapter contains information about developing your own runtimes or example applications, contributing changes to existing ones, and improving {name-launcher}.

include::topics/assembly_updating-examples-catalog-for-local-openshiftlocal-testing.adoc[leveloffset=+2] <5>

You can preview the latest state of {name-launcher} by navigating to the link:{launcher-stage}[stage build] of {name-launcher}.

<1> Includes a file that sets common attributes across all guides.
<2> A comment that will not be rendered in the final output.
<3> Defines a new attribute called `docs-topic`
<4> Sets the document title, in this case it uses the existing attribute `contrib-guide-name`. This attribute is defined in `$REPO_HOME/docs/topics/templates/document-attributes.adoc`.
<5> Adds the content from `$REPO_HOME/docs/topics/assembly-updating-examples-catalog-for-local-minishift-testing.adoc` and adds a link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-partitioning[level offset] of two, which means heading levels are offset by two. For example, first-level headings in `$REPO_HOME/docs/topics/assembly-updating-examples-catalog-for-local-minishift-testing.adoc` are rendered as third-level headings.

There are a few important concepts that are heavily used that you need to learn:

document-attributes file::
  `$REPO_HOME/docs/topics/templates/document-attributes.adoc` sets common variables that are used across all the guides. Every guide includes this file.
partitioning content::
  Sections of content in each guide are separated into smaller files. This allows for content to be easily refactored within a guide as well as reused across different guides. The `include` directive is used to include these files in a piece of content.
modular documentation::
  An individual piece of content, called a module, is formatted in xref:writing-the-modular-way_{context}[a specific way], which allows for better reuse across guides.
common topics directory::
  All of the smaller content files and modules are located in the `$REPO_HOME/docs/topics/` directory. This is a common directory that contains all shared files across all guides. To help the build process, the `$REPO_HOME/docs/topics/` directory is symlinked in each guide's directory.
