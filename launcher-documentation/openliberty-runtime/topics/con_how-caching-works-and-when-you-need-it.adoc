= How caching works and when you need it

Caches allows you to store information and access it for a given period of time.
You can access information in a cache faster or more reliably than repeatedly calling the original service.
A disadvantage of using a cache is that the cached information is not up to date.
However, that problem can be reduced by setting an _expiration_ or TTL (time to live) on each value stored in the cache.

.Caching example
====
Assume you have two applications: _service1_ and _service2_:

* _Service1_ depends on a value from _service2_.
** If the value from _service2_ infrequently changes, _service1_ could cache the value from _service2_ for a period of time.
** Using cached values can also reduce the number of times _service2_ is called.
* If it takes _service1_ 500 ms to retrieve the value directly from _service2_, but 100 ms to retrieve the cached value, _service1_ would save 400 ms by using the cached value for each cached call.
* If _service1_ would make uncached calls to _service2_ 5 times per second, over 10 seconds, that would be 50 calls.
* If _service1_ started using a cached value with a TTL of 1 second instead, that would be reduced to 10 calls over 10 seconds.

.How the {name-example-cache} example works

. The _cache_, _cute name_, and _greeting_ services are deployed and exposed.
. User accesses the web frontend of the _greeting_ service.
. User invokes the _greeting_ HTTP API using a button on the web frontend.
. The _greeting_ service depends on a value from the _cute name_ service.
** The _greeting_ service first checks if that value is stored in the _cache_ service. If it is, then the cached value is returned.
** If the value is not cached, the _greeting_ service calls the _cute name_ service, returns the value, and stores the value in the _cache_ service with a TTL of 5 seconds.
. The web front end displays the response from the _greeting_ service as well as the total time of the operation.
. User invokes the service multiple times to see the difference between cached and uncached operations.
** Cached operations are significantly faster than uncached operations.
** User can force the cache to be cleared before the TTL expires.
