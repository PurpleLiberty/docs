= How the {name-launcher} tool works

The {name-launcher} tool runs on OpenShift and lets you create functional example applications. The {name-launcher} tool walks you through:

* choosing the example application you want to generate,
* choosing the runtime you want to use, and
* choosing how you want to build and execute the example application.

The {name-launcher} tool uses your choices to generate a custom project, called an example application, and either launches it directly to the same OpenShift instance, or provides a downloadable ZIP version of the project.
