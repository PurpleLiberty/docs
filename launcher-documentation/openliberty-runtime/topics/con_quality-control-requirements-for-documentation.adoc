= Quality control requirements for documentation

To ensure good quality of the documentation, the following requirements must be met:

* Each pull request must be reviewed by at least:
** One member of the documentation team (different from the submitter).
** One member of either the engineering team or the QE team.

* When a new version of the documentation is pushed to the Customer Portal stage, a member of the QE team must review the diff between the live version and the new version.
