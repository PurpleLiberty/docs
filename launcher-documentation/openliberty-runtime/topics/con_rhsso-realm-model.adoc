= {RHSSO} realm model

The `master` realm is used to secure this example.
There are two pre-configured application client definitions that provide a model for command line clients and the secured REST endpoint.

There are also two pre-configured users in the {RHSSO} `master` realm that can be used to validate various authentication and authorization outcomes:  `admin` and `alice`.

== {RHSSO} users
The realm model for the secured examples includes two users:

admin::
The `admin` user has a password of `admin` and is the realm administrator.
This user has full access to the {RHSSO} administration console, but none of the role mappings that are required to access the secured endpoints.
You can use this user to illustrate the behavior of an authenticated, but unauthorized user.

alice::
The `alice` user has a password of `password` and is the canonical application user.
This user will demonstrate successful authenticated and authorized access to the secured endpoints.
An example representation of the role mappings is provided in this decoded JWT bearer token:

<1> The `iss` field corresponds to the {RHSSO} realm instance URL that issues the token. This must be configured in the secured endpoint deployments in order for the token to be verified.
<2> The `roles` object provides the roles that have been granted to the user at the global realm level. In this case
`alice` has been granted the `example-admin` role. We will see that the secured endpoint will look to the realm level for authorized roles.
<3> The `resource_access` object contains resource specific role grants. Under this object you will find an object
for each of the secured endpoints.
<4> The `resource_access.secured-example-endpoint.roles` object contains the roles granted to `alice` for the `secured-example-endpoint` resource.
<5> The `preferred_username` field provides the username that was used to generate the access token.

== The application clients
The OAuth 2.0 specification allows you to define a role for application clients that access secured resources on behalf of resource owners. The `master` realm has the following application clients defined:

demoapp::
This is a `confidential` type client with a client secret that is used to obtain an access token. The token contains grants for the `alice` user which enable `alice` to access the {WildFlySwarm}, {VertX}, {Node} and {SpringBoot} based REST example application deployments.

secured-example-endpoint::
The `secured-example-endpoint` is a bearer-only type of client that requires a `example-admin` role for accessing the associated resources, specifically the Greeting service.
