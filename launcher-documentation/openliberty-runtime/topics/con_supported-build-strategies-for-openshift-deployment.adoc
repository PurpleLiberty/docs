= Supported Build Strategies for OpenShift Deployment

OpenShift supports different link:https://docs.openshift.com/online/dev_guide/builds/index.html[build strategies] including Source-to-Image and Jenkins Pipeline.
{ProductName} example applications use the link:https://docs.openshift.com/online/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-to-Image strategy] (S2I) for simplicity of use and implementation.
Other build strategies, such as the Jenkins Pipeline, are more complex, for example employing multiple servers for building or using webhooks to trigger builds.

Example applications created using the _Build and Deploy to OpenShift_ build process, which is based on the S2I build strategy, can also be executed locally, as well as built locally and manually deployed to OpenShift.

For more information on these options, see the `README.adoc` file of your example application.
