= The externalized configuration design pattern

Whenever possible, externalize the application configuration and separate it from the application code.
This allows the application configuration to change as it moves through different environments, but leaves the code unchanged.
Externalizing the configuration also keeps sensitive or internal information out of your code base and version control.
Many languages and application servers provide environment variables to support externalizing an application's configuration.

Microservices architectures and multi-language (polyglot) environments add a layer of complexity to managing an application's configuration.
Applications consist of independent, distributed services, and each can have its own configuration.
Keeping all configuration data synchronized and accessible creates a maintenance challenge.

ConfigMaps enable the application configuration to be externalized and used in individual Linux containers and pods on OpenShift.
You can create a ConfigMap object in a variety of ways, including using a YAML file, and inject it into the Linux container.
ConfigMaps also allow you to group and scale sets of configuration data.
This lets you configure a large number of environments beyond the basic _Development_, _Stage_, and _Production_.
You can find more information about ConfigMaps in the link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/configmaps.html[OpenShift documentation].
