= Writing the modular way

When authoring new content, do not write a monolithic piece of text, but write the information in smaller, self-contained pieces called modules.
The modules used in this documentation use the templates described in the link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/[Red Hat Modular Documentation Reference Guide].

NOTE: You will be asked to modify new content that you submit if it does not follow the correct templates.
