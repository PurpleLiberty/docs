= Accessing JVM metrics using Jolokia on OpenShift

link:https://jolokia.org/documentation.html[Jolokia^] is a built-in lightweight solution for accessing JMX (Java Management Extension) metrics over HTTP on OpenShift.
Jolokia allows you to access CPU, storage, and memory usage data collected by JMX over an HTTP bridge.
Jolokia uses a REST interface and JSON-formatted message payloads.
It is suitable for monitoring cloud applications thanks to its comparably high speed and low resource requirements.

For Java-based applications, the OpenShift Web console provides the integrated link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html#jvm-console[_hawt.io_ console^] that collects and displays all relevant metrics output by the JVM running your application.

.Prerequistes

* the `oc` client authenticated
* a Java-based application container running in a project on OpenShift
* latest link:https://github.com/jboss-container-images/redhat-openjdk-18-openshift-image/blob/openjdk18-dev/image.yaml[JDK 1.8.0 image^]

.Procedure

. List the deployment configurations of the pods inside your project and select the one that corresponds to your application.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
--
oc get dc
--
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
NAME         REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
{value-name-app}   2          1         1         config,image(my-app:6)
...
----
+
. Open the YAML deployment template of the pod running your application for editing.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
--
oc edit dc/{value-name-app}
--
+
. Add the following entry to the `ports` section of the template and save your changes:
+
[source,yaml]
--
...
spec:
  ...
  ports:
  - containerPort: 8778
    name: jolokia
    protocol: TCP
  ...
...
--
+
. Redeploy the pod running your application.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
--
oc rollout latest dc/{value-name-app}
--
+
// The above workflow can also be accomplished using the web console
The pod is redeployed with the updated deployment configuration and exposes the port `8778`.
+
. Log into the OpenShift Web console.
+
. In the sidebar, navigate to _Applications_ > _Pods_, and click on the name of the pod running your application.
+
. In the pod details screen, click _Open Java Console_ to access the hawt.io console.
