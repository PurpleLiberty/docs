= Creating and deploying an example application using an OpenShift Cluster

You can quickly create, build, and deploy an example application to an OpenShift Cluster using the {name-launcher} tool. The {name-launcher} tool creates a new repository in your GitHub account containing the example application's code and deploys it to your OpenShift Cluster. It can also create a ZIP of the example application for you to download and run on your localhost.
