= Installing {name-launcher} tool manually

Install a local customized instance of the {name-launcher} tool, which allows you to test the functionality or make modifications to the service using a web interface.

.Prerequisites
* {OpenShiftLocal} installed and running.
* A link:{link-guide-minishift-installation}#creating-a-github-personal-access-token_minishift[GitHub personal access token].

.Procedure
. Open the {OpenShiftLocal} Web console and log in.
. Click _New Project_ to create a new OpenShift project to house the {name-launcher} tool.

. Name the project and optionally provide a description. This example uses `my-launcher` for the project's name.
+

. Click _Create_ to complete the project creation.

. Click _Import YAML/JSON_ to add services to your new project from a template.
+

. Copy the contents of link:{link-launcher-yaml}[the current {name-launcher} template from the GitHub repository^] and paste it into the text box provided.

. Click _Create_, ensure that only the _Process the template_ option is selected, and click _Continue_.

. Fill out the following fields.
** _Your GitHub username_.
** _Your GitHub Mission Control access token_ is your personal access token for GitHub.
** The _Target OpenShift Console URL_ is the OpenShift Console URL from your {OpenShiftLocal}. This should be the same base URL you are currently using to complete the form, for example `+++https://192.168.42.152:8443+++`.
** OpenShift username and password from your {OpenShiftLocal}, for example `developer` for the username and password.
** _KeyCloak URL_ and _KeyCloak Realm_ **MUST** be cleared out.
+
WARNING: You must clear these fields out for the {name-launcher} tool on your {OpenShiftLocal} to be configured correctly.

ifndef::parameter-custom-catalog[** Do not modify _Catalog Git Repository_ and _Catalog Git Reference_ unless you are developing against a specific catalog repository.]
ifdef::parameter-custom-catalog[** Set _Catalog Git Repository_ to the repository with the catalog that you are testing. Set _Catalog Git Reference_ to the branch in that repository you are testing.]

. Before proceeding to the next steps, confirm all the fields are correct. Also confirm that _KeyCloak URL_ and _KeyCloak Realm_ **have been cleared out**.

. Click `Create` to complete the setup. You will see a screen confirming that the service has been created. Click _Continue to overview_.

. On the overview page, wait and confirm that the four pods for the {name-launcher} tool have completed starting up.
+

. When all pods are running, click the link at the top of all pods, which typically ends in `nip.io`. 
+
A new browser tab opens with the {name-launcher} tool. This is the same service as `{link-launcher-oso}` but running in a {OpenShiftLocal}.

. Start using your {name-launcher} tool to launch example applications.

.Additional resources
* See the link:{link-guide-getting-started}[{name-guide-getting-started}] for a walk-through of running an example application.
