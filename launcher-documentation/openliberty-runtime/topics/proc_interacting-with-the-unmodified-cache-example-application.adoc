.Procedure

. Navigate to the `greeting` service using your browser.

. Click _Invoke the service_ once.
+
Notice the `duration` value is above `2000`.
Also notice the cache state has changed form `No cached value` to `A value is cached`.

. Wait 5 seconds and notice cache state has changed back to `No cached value`.
+
The TTL for the cached value is set to 5 seconds.
When the TTL expires, the value is no longer cached.

. Click _Invoke the service_ once more to cache the value.

. Click _Invoke the service_ a few more times over the course of a few seconds while cache state is `A value is cached`.
+
Notice a significantly lower `duration` value since it is using a cached value.
If you click _Clear the cache_, the cache is emptied.
