= Reviewing changes

Ensure you perform all the following actions when reviewing a pull request:

.Prerequisites

* GitHub account with administration privileges to Jenkins builds. For more information, see xref:reviewing_changes_related_information[] in this chapter.

.Procedure

.Reviewing Pull Request
. If there is a comment from the `centos-ci` user asking _Can one of the admins verify this patch?,_ the pull request comes from an external contributor.

Approve the build or add the author to the list of trusted contributors.
For more information, see xref:jenkins-ci-commands_{context}[].

. Check if the build passed.
+
If it failed, review the build log by clicking *Show all checks* -> *Details* in the box at the bottom of the comment section. In the page that opens, click *Console Output*. Search for the string _Running tests..._ and diagnose the problem.
. Click the *Files Changed* tab and review the changes. Pay special attention to the following matters:
+
--
// TODO link to the Requirements part once written
** Correct use of attributes.
** Correct file placement in the repository layout.
** Correct naming of products.

If you are unsure if the changes render correctly, build the contribution locally:

. Add the contributor's repository as a new remote and fetch it.
. Checkout the source branch of the pull request. You can find it below the pull request title in the *from* field.
. Run the preview server locally and review the built documentation.
