= Starting and configuring {Minishift} for the {name-launcher} tool

This chapter contains instructions for starting the {Minishift} and configuring it to execute the {name-launcher} tool.

NOTE: Starting your {Minishift} can trigger a download of large virtual machines or Linux container images. This can take a long time. Subsequent startups are expected to be shorter if the virtual machines and Linux container images remain cached.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because {Minishift} is intended for development purposes, it uses HTTPS for the web console and only provides a self-signed certificate. If your browser prevents you from accessing the page due to an SSL error, you must allow your browser to bypass SSL security policies for the {Minishift} URL to use it. The screenshot below shows the warning message in the Google Chrome browser.

.Procedure

. Start {Minishift} with the default virtual machine driver:
+
--
NOTE: Depending on your operating system, virtual machine driver, and the number of example applications you run, the memory allocated {OpenShiftLocal} can be insufficient. In this case, increase the memory allocation.

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift start --memory=4096
...
OpenShift server started.

The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://192.168.42.152:8443
----

Alternatively, specify a virtual machine driver other than the default using the `--vm-driver` flag:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift start --memory=4096 --vm-driver=virtualbox
----

Depending on your system configuration, it is possible that you must manually specify an alternative virtual machine driver. You must have virtual machine software, such as link:https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox], installed before you specify it.

NOTE: On macOS, the default virtual machine driver, `xhyve`, can be unreliable. If you experience issues, specifying `VirtualBox` is a reliable alternative.

. Open the {Minishift} Web console.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ minishift console
----
+
Alternatively, use the URL provided in the log information.

. Log in using the `developer` username and an arbitrary password.

. Optionally, delete the preconfigured project:
.. Next to the project name, click the three-dot menu icon.
.. Select _Delete Project_.
