= Starting preview server

You can preview the documentation site locally by building and deploying the Docker containers with the documentation site on your machine.

.Prerequisites

* Docker installed.
* Docker daemon running.

.Procedure

.Running Preview Server Locally
. Execute the `scripts/preview_server.sh` script.
If you execute it as a regular user, you will be asked for administrator privileges because they are required for operating the `docker` binary.

NOTE: We do not recommend adding the regular user to the `docker` group. For more information, see the Related Information section below.

. Navigate to `http://localhost` in your browser.
. When you are done, stop the Docker container with the server:
.. Go back to the terminal where the script is running.
.. Press `Ctrl + C`.
