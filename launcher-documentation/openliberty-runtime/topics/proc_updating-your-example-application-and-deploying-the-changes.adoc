= Updating your example application and deploying the changes

To push changes to an example application running in {OpenShiftOnline} or your {OpenShiftLocal}, you can push a new commit to the GitHub repository and start a new build.

.Prerequisites

* Have an example application deployed to {OpenShiftOnline}, or {OpenShiftLocal} using the _Deploy in OpenShift Online_ option.


.Procedure
. Clone your project from GitHub:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/PROJECT-NAME.git
----

. Open your project in your desired IDE or editor, such as xref:using-red-hat-jboss-developer-studio-with-an-example-application-project_{context}[{DevStudio}].
. Make an update to the project.
. Save your changes.
. Commit and push your changes back to GitHub:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Made an update"
$ git push
----

. Navigate back to the {OpenShiftOnline} or {OpenShiftLocal} Web console and ensure the project of your example application is selected.
. Click on the three dots on the right side of your application's deployment and choose _Start Build_.
+
Your deployment is complete when you see _Build #2 is complete_ under _Builds_ and a `#2` next to the application name under _Deployment_. This number will increase for each additional build and deployment.

. Confirm your changes when your deployment is complete.
