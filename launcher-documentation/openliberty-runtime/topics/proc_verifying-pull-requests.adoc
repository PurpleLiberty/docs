.Procedure

. When you see a notification of a new pull request, navigate to it and review the contents according to the  description in the pull request and the issue it resolves.
+
NOTE: If there is no reference to an open issue and the change is not trivial, request that an issue be created.
+
.. Preview the rendered documentation with the changes from the pull request by navigating to the `Conversation` tab of the pull request, clicking _Show All Checks_, and _Details_ next to the revealed `deploy/netlify`.
+
NOTE: Even though the page says _Prepare to launch..._ you are in the right place. Click _Docs_ in the top bar to navigate to the edited documentation.

Fill in the general description of the changes you require.
Comment on individual problems directly in the code using the comment functionality in GitHub.
** Open a separate pull request against the private branch of the original submitter.

Repeat the process as necessary.

. When your requested changes are addressed, approve the pull request.
