== Running the Example Application Locally

To run this example application on your local host:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ ${gitCMD}

$ cd ${targetRepository}

$ ${localRunCMD}
----

== Interacting with the Example Application Locally

To interact with your example application while it's running locally, use the form at `http://localhost:8080` or the `curl` command:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, World!"}

$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/greeting?name=Sarah

+
NOTE: To stop your running example application in a Linux or macOS terminal, use `CTRL+C`. In a Windows command prompt, you can use `CTRL + Break(pause)`.

. Make your change (e.g. edit `${fileLocation}`).
. Restart your example application.
. Verify the change took effect.


== Running the Example Application on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster
If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://launcher.fabric8.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can also deploy your example application there. A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

To deploy your example application to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer

$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME

$ ${OSORunCMD}
----
