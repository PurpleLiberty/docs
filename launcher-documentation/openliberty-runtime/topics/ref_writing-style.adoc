== Writing rules specific to this repository

When writing new content, adhere to the following rules:

* When using the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#En_dash[en dash], use the `\{ndash\}` attribute.

Do *not* use:

* `&amp;ndash;` because it breaks validation.
* `&amp;#x2013;` even though `\{ndash\}` is currently set to it, because the attribute can change in the future.
