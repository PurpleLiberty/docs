= Tracing Requests

Distributed tracing helps troubleshoot microservices by examining and logging requests as they propagate through a distributed system, allowing developers to tackle the otherwise difficult task of debugging these requests. Without a distributed tracing system in place, it's difficult to analyze workflows and pinpoint when and by whom a request is received or a when response is returned.

To learn how to monitor and trace logging requests across microservices in an application, see link:https://www.openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-opentracing.html[Enabling distributed tracing in microservices].
